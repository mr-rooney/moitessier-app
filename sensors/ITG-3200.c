/*
    User space program to check communication with the ITG-3200 sensor connected to
    the IO expansion header of the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. You need to use i2c-gpio-param 
    (GPIO bitbanged I2C) to communicate with the sensor.
    This source code is for demonstation purpose only and was tested
    on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.
